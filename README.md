A game replicating the horror style of the F.E.A.R series. Focusing on creating an immersive experience
with human like state-machine based AI enemies. Worked on cover detection systems and flanking
systems. Incomplete but proof of concepts for core technologies present. 

This project was for the Project Exhibiton I in the 2nd Year of B.Tech CSE and continued through Project Exhibition II
